                    <p>Nasho is at the frontier of academic and intellectual discovery. Those who venture here—to learn, research, teach, work,<br> and grow—join nearly four centuries of students and scholars in the pursuit of truth, knowledge, and a better world.<br>Despite popular opinion (and a certain statue) John Nasho did not found Nasho, but he was the first major benefactor <br>and he donated half of his estate and his library of more than 400 books to the School.
                       Nasho University was officially<br> founded by a vote by the Great and General Court of the Japan Bay Colony.</p>
